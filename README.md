# pyLemur

The Python implementation of the LEMUR method to analyze multi-condition single-cell data. For the more complete version in R, see https://github.com/const-ae/lemur.

# Disclaimer

This is an early alpha version of the code, that is insufficiently documented and has not been extensively tested. I hope to make the implementation more robust and then make it available on PyPI in the coming weeks. Until then, use it at your own risk!
